# Expo SDK 53 Compatibility Fixes

## Summary

Fixed all Expo-related errors and warnings for the BMT Web3 Mobile App running on port 4004.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Git Configuration

- **Issue**: The `.expo` directory was not ignored by Git
- **Fix**: Created `.gitignore` file with proper Expo-specific entries
- **Impact**: Prevents committing machine-specific Expo state

### 2. Lock File Conflicts

- **Issue**: Multiple lock files detected (`yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json`)
- **Fix**: Removed `yarn.lock`, keeping only `package-lock.json` as the project uses npm
- **Impact**: Consistent dependency resolution in CI/CD environments

### 3. Missing Peer Dependency

- **Issue**: `react-native-gesture-handler` was missing but required by `@react-navigation/stack`
- **Fix**: Added `react-native-gesture-handler@~2.24.0` to dependencies
- **Impact**: Prevents app crashes when using stack navigation

### 4. Package Version Incompatibilities

- **Issue**: Several packages were not compatible with Expo SDK 53
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: `^2.2.0` → `2.1.2`
  - `expo-secure-store`: `^14.2.3` → `~14.2.4`
  - `react-dom`: `^19.1.1` → `19.0.0`
  - `react-native`: `0.79.6` → `0.79.5`
  - `react-native-safe-area-context`: `^5.6.1` → `5.4.0`
  - `react-native-screens`: `^4.15.4` → `~4.11.1`
  - `babel-preset-expo`: `13.2.3` → `~13.0.0`
- **Impact**: Full compatibility with Expo SDK 53

## Verification Results

- ✅ All `expo-doctor` checks pass (17/17)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ App runs successfully on port 4004
- ✅ Web bundle builds without errors
- ✅ All dependencies installed successfully

## Current Status

The BMT Web3 Mobile App is now fully compatible with Expo SDK 53 and running without errors. The app can be accessed at:

- Web: http://localhost:4004
- iOS: Run `npm run ios`
- Android: Run `npm run android`

## Commands for Future Reference

```bash
# Run diagnostics
npx expo-doctor

# Clear cache if needed
npm run clean

# Start development servers
npm run web    # Web on port 4004
npm run ios    # iOS simulator
npm run android # Android emulator
```

## Notes

- The cache warning on first start after dependency updates is normal
- ESLint v8 deprecation warnings are expected and don't affect functionality
- The app uses npm as the package manager (not yarn)
