# CCXT Integration Migration Guide

## Overview

The BMT Web3 Mobile App has been successfully migrated from custom exchange API implementations to the industry-standard CCXT library. This migration resolves the previous issues with HMAC-SHA512 signature generation and provides a unified, battle-tested approach to exchange integrations.

## ✅ What Has Been Accomplished

### 1. CCXT Library Integration

- ✅ Installed CCXT v4.5.2 with React Native support
- ✅ Added `react-native-get-random-values` polyfill for crypto operations
- ✅ Configured CCXT for mobile/React Native environment

### 2. New CCXT-Based Services

- ✅ Created `ccxtExchange.service.ts` with unified exchange API
- ✅ Updated `futuresTrading.service.ts` to use CCXT instead of custom API
- ✅ Deprecated `exchangeApi.service.ts` (marked for removal)

### 3. React Native Optimization

- ✅ Added React Native specific configurations
- ✅ Implemented mobile-friendly error handling
- ✅ Added network connectivity checks
- ✅ Optimized timeouts and rate limiting for mobile networks

### 4. Supported Operations

- ✅ Connection testing and authentication
- ✅ Balance fetching (spot and futures)
- ✅ Position management
- ✅ Order placement and cancellation
- ✅ Market data fetching
- ✅ Multiple exchange support (Binance & Gate.io)

## 🔧 Key Benefits

### Resolved Issues

1. **HMAC-SHA512 Signature Problems**: CCXT handles all cryptographic operations automatically
2. **API Permission Issues**: Unified API works with standard exchange permissions
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Battle-tested implementations reduce custom code maintenance
4. **Exchange-Specific Bugs**: CCXT provides consistent behavior across exchanges

### New Features

1. **Unified API**: Same interface for both Binance and Gate.io
2. **Automatic Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API limits
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Mobile-specific error messages and network detection
4. **Better Security**: Industry-standard signature generation and request handling

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Initialize Exchange Connection

```typescript
import futuresTradingService from './services/futuresTrading.service';

// Connect to Gate.io (resolves permission issues from screenshot)
const result = await futuresTradingService.initializeExchange({
  exchange: 'gate',
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
  apiSecret: 'your_api_secret',
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('✅ Connected to Gate.io via CCXT');
} else {
  console.error('❌ Connection failed:', result.message);
}
```

### Get Account Balance

```typescript
// Get futures balance using CCXT
const balance = await futuresTradingService.getAccountBalance('gate');
console.log('Balance:', balance);
```

### Fetch Positions

```typescript
// Get all positions via CCXT
const positions = await futuresTradingService.getPositions('gate');
console.log('Active positions:', positions.length);
```

### Place Orders

```typescript
// Place market order using CCXT
const order = await futuresTradingService.openPosition({
  exchange: 'gate',
  symbol: 'BTC/USDT',
  side: 'buy',
  amount: 0.001,
});

if (order.success) {
  console.log('✅ Order placed:', order.orderId);
}
```

### Get Market Data

```typescript
// Fetch real-time market data
const marketData = await futuresTradingService.getMarketData('gate', 'BTC/USDT');
console.log('BTC/USDT price:', marketData.last);
```

## 🔑 API Key Permissions

### Gate.io Requirements

Based on the user's screenshot, ensure your Gate.io API key has these permissions:

- ✅ Spot Trade (Read And Write)
- ✅ Perpetual Futures (Read And Write)
- ✅ Wallet (Read And Write)
- ✅ Account (Read And Write)
- ❌ Margin Trading (Unified Account) - NOT needed with CCXT

### Binance Requirements

For Binance API keys, ensure:

- ✅ Enable Spot & Margin Trading
- ✅ Enable Futures
- ✅ Enable Reading
- ✅ Whitelist IP addresses if required

## 🏗️ File Structure

### New Files

- `src/services/ccxtExchange.service.ts` - CCXT-based exchange service
- `src/config/ccxtSetup.ts` - React Native configuration and polyfills
- `src/tests/ccxtIntegration.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `CCXT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files

- `src/services/futuresTrading.service.ts` - Updated to use CCXT
- `package.json` - Added CCXT and polyfill dependencies

### Deprecated Files

- `src/services/exchangeApi.service.ts` - Marked for removal after testing

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

```typescript
import { runManualCCXTTests } from './src/tests/ccxtIntegration.test';

// Test real connection (development only)
const result = await runManualCCXTTests.testRealConnection({
  exchange: 'gate',
  apiKey: 'your_key',
  apiSecret: 'your_secret',
});

console.log('Connection test:', result);
```

### Diagnostics

```typescript
import futuresTradingService from './services/futuresTrading.service';

// Run CCXT diagnostics
const diagnostics = await futuresTradingService.testPositionFetching('gate');
console.log('CCXT Diagnostics:', diagnostics);
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### CCXT Configuration

The CCXT library is configured in `src/config/ccxtSetup.ts`:

- Mobile-optimized timeouts (30 seconds)
- Conservative rate limiting (1.2 seconds between requests)
- Automatic signature generation
- Enhanced error handling for mobile networks

### Environment Variables

No changes needed to existing environment variables. CCXT works with the same API keys and secrets.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development

```bash
npm install  # CCXT dependencies already added
npm run dev  # Start development server
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run typecheck    # Verify TypeScript
npm run lint         # Code quality check
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Invalid API credentials"

- **Cause**: API key format or permissions
- **Solution**: Verify key length and permissions as shown above

#### 2. "Network request failed"

- **Cause**: Mobile network issues or exchange downtime
- **Solution**: CCXT includes automatic retry logic and network detection

#### 3. "Signature mismatch"

- **Cause**: Previously caused by custom HMAC implementation
- **Solution**: ✅ Resolved by CCXT automatic signature generation

#### 4. React Native crypto issues

- **Cause**: Missing polyfills
- **Solution**: ✅ Resolved by `react-native-get-random-values` import

### Debug Mode

```typescript
import ccxtExchangeService from './services/ccxtExchange.service';

// Get CCXT version and capabilities
const diagnostics = ccxtExchangeService.getDiagnostics();
console.log('CCXT Version:', diagnostics.ccxtVersion);
console.log('Supported:', diagnostics.supportedExchanges);
```

## 📈 Performance Improvements
